# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DinoOverlay Code Snippet System is a universal real estate image editing overlay that can be injected into any website via a simple script tag. The system provides a glassmorphic UI overlay that detects room images and offers AI-powered editing capabilities through quick actions and chat interface. The overlay operates independently of the host site's framework and maintains consistent modern styling across all implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a real estate website visitor, I want to see an interactive overlay on room images, so that I can easily identify which images can be edited with AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads with the DinoOverlay script THEN the system SHALL automatically detect all images with the `.editable-room` class
2. WHEN an editable room image is detected THEN the system SHALL add a subtle glassmorphic border overlay that matches the image's dimensions and border radius
3. WHEN a user hovers over an editable image THEN the system SHALL display a glowing border animation
4. IF an image has rounded corners THEN the overlay SHALL match those exact corner radii
5. WHEN multiple editable images exist on a page THEN each SHALL receive its own independent overlay

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a real estate website visitor, I want to access quick editing actions for room images, so that I can apply common styling changes without typing detailed prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an editable room image THEN the system SHALL slide in a quick action sidebar from the right
2. WHEN the quick action sidebar opens THEN it SHALL display pre-defined style buttons including "Minimalist", "Scandi Style", "Add Sofa", and "Add Furniture"
3. WHEN a user clicks a quick action button THEN the system SHALL send the corresponding prompt and image data to the backend API
4. WHEN a quick action is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the selected image
5. WHEN the backend returns an edited image THEN the system SHALL display the result in the overlay
6. WHEN a user clicks outside the sidebar THEN it SHALL slide out and close

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a real estate website visitor, I want to use natural language to describe image edits, so that I can request custom modifications beyond the quick actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the overlay is active THEN the system SHALL display a floating chat bar in the bottom-right corner
2. WHEN a user types in the chat input THEN the system SHALL accept free-form text prompts
3. WHEN a user submits a chat message THEN the system SHALL send the prompt and currently selected image to the backend API
4. WHEN the chat is processing a request THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators and loading states
5. WHEN the backend returns a response THEN the system SHALL display the edited image and any status messages
6. IF no image is selected WHEN a chat message is sent THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select an image first

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to add the DinoOverlay system with minimal effort, so that I can enhance my real estate listings without complex integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a website owner adds the script snippet THEN the system SHALL load asynchronously without blocking page rendering
2. WHEN the script loads THEN it SHALL create a Shadow DOM container to isolate all overlay styles and functionality
3. WHEN the overlay initializes THEN it SHALL not interfere with the host website's existing CSS or JavaScript
4. IF the host website uses any CSS framework THEN the overlay SHALL maintain its glassmorphic styling independently
5. WHEN the script is removed THEN all overlay functionality SHALL be completely removed without leaving artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the DinoOverlay system, I want the overlay to communicate with a backend API, so that AI image processing can be handled server-side.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers an image edit action THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/overlay/edit-image` with image data and prompt
2. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/overlay/chat` with the message and context
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers and request formatting
4. IF an API request fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle both success and error states gracefully
6. WHEN large images are processed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators during upload and processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a real estate website visitor, I want the overlay interface to be visually appealing and modern, so that it enhances rather than detracts from my browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the overlay renders THEN it SHALL use glassmorphic design with backdrop-blur effects
2. WHEN overlay elements appear THEN they SHALL use semi-transparent backgrounds with subtle gradients
3. WHEN animations occur THEN they SHALL be smooth with appropriate easing functions
4. WHEN the sidebar slides in THEN it SHALL animate from right to left with a duration of 300ms
5. WHEN buttons are hovered THEN they SHALL show subtle glow and scale effects
6. IF the host website has a dark theme THEN the overlay SHALL adapt its transparency and contrast accordingly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the overlay system to work across different frameworks and CMS platforms, so that I can use it regardless of my site's technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is injected into a WordPress site THEN it SHALL function without conflicts
2. WHEN the script is injected into a React application THEN it SHALL not interfere with React's virtual DOM
3. WHEN the script is injected into plain HTML sites THEN it SHALL work with standard DOM manipulation
4. IF the host site uses jQuery THEN the overlay SHALL not conflict with existing jQuery functionality
5. WHEN the script loads on mobile devices THEN it SHALL provide touch-friendly interactions and responsive sizing
